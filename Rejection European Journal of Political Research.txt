The politics of disaggregated family policy: the role of partisanship and female political representation

Dear Dr. Wiß,

We have now received the referee reports on your paper. They are rather critical, and we do agree with them. We can therefore not accept the manuscript for publication. As you will know, we receive a very high number of submissions, and we are only able to publish a few of them. That makes the selection process very severe indeed.

You will find the comments of the referees in the file attached to this mail or at the bottom of this message - depending on how the reviewers submitted their report to the journal. We hope that you will be able to find a suitable journal to publish your work.

Thank you for considering the European Journal of Political Research for the publication of your research. We hope the outcome will not discourage you from submitting manuscripts to the EJPR in the future.

Sincerely,

Isabelle Engeli, Emiliano Grossman and Sofia Vasilopoulou

### Comments to the Author
While it has a promising premise, this article does not engage with the literature on **substantive representation by women in cabinet**. See: Annesley & Gains (multiple), Atchison (2015), Atchison & Down (2019), Bergqvist (2011), Mushaben (2005), and more. (see public expenditure/ideology Kleider, et al 2018, too)
The article also  fails to connect with the **cabinet governance &  executive dominance literatures** (cabinets have far more power in some states than others. One would not expect secretaries in the American cabinet to have the same type of influence as ministers in the UK cabinet, for example - Doring, 1995; Siaroff 2003, Tsebelis 2009...). Which brings me to the **case selection** - the authors do not explain their case selection (and put the country-year information in the appendix!), but I can see from Figures 1 & 2 that they do include the US and CHE, neither of which are parliamentary systems which makes their inclusion in an article on cabinet influence problematic at best (See Doring, 1995 / Siaroff, 2003).

Given the lack of serious engagement with either the women in cabinets or the cabinet governance literatures, I cannot recommend publication.

### Comments to the Author
This manuscript analyses whether women’s representation in cabinets and the ideology of governments influence different types of family policy. The authors take a differentiated approach by distinguishing between different types of family policy, and particularly support for families, which have different rationales and implications with respect to gender equality and women’s labour market participation. They employ a sophisticated design using error correction models to study cross-sectional time-series data from almost 30 countries. The findings show that government ideology influences different policy instruments in different ways, and that the role of women in cabinet depends on the parties in cabinet. The manuscript has the potential to make some important contributions to the literatures on women’s descriptive and substantive representation and on family policy specifically. The differentiated approach, taking into account the  underlying logics of policies aimed at childcare, is both innovative and substantively important. The methodological sophistication of the study is also impressive. Unfortunately, I struggled a bit to **follow the arguments** and – even more so – the **results**. There is simply a lot going on and the manuscript needs some clarification and perhaps restructuring in order to help the reader understand what the findings are, how they relate to the expectations, and what the overall conclusions and implications are. Accordingly, most of my comments below address different points in the manuscript that I found to be unclear. Yet, I believe that with some more work on these issues the study can be turned into an impactful publication, as the theoretical framework and research design themselves are very convincing in my view. In my comments below I proceed in the order of the text. 

#### Intro and abstract
- The last sentence of the abstract on the interaction result could be phrased more clearly.
- The details about previous studies in the introduction (p. 2) could be moved into the lit review in order to make the intro more effective. The limitations (p. 2, lines 47-59) and how this study addresses them can still be outlined here, without discussing each study in detail.
- I recommend outlining the findings and implications at the end of the introduction.

#### Theoretical framework
- Why do the authors focus on the cabinet share of women? Many other studies look at parliament (and the authors include this as a control), so this deserves a brief discussion.
- The expectations regarding which policies are likely to be affected by women’s representation, and why, could be specified further. The authors refer to childcare spending and leave in this context, but what about family allowances?
- The explanation leading up to H4a needs to be clarified (p. 7). Is it that left-wing women politicians are more likely to support gender equality than right-wing women politicians, or that left-wing parties are more likely to be responsive to the demands for gender equality of the women in their party? Or both?
- p. 7: “However, there seems to be a limit to the critical mass assumption.”: I don’t see how the previous discussion relates to the **critical mass argument**, which proposes that a certain proportion/number of women needs to be present for them to have an impact. This should be clarified, or the reference to this assumption be removed. Further below, before H5a, critical mass theory is again mentioned but I’m not sure whether this is really what the authors mean; they seem to argue that an increase in women has a stronger effect at lower overall numbers of women. This is an interesting idea but I don’t think it is in line with the critical mass argument.

#### Data and methods
- Regarding party ideology: should Christian Democratic parties really be coded as centre rather than right? What is the definition of left and right used here? Is it economic, cultural, or both?
- Regarding the control variables, if institutional factors might influence the relationship between political factors and family policy, then these variables should be included as moderating variables rather than controls (p. 11). To what extent do all of these variables have within-country variation, given that fixed effects models are estimated?
- The list of countries should be included somewhere in the main document, not just the appendix.

#### Results
Overall, I found it a bit tedious to make sense of the results section. There are many different dependent variables, long-term and short-term effects, and three separate measures of government composition that are interacted with the share of women in cabinet. I wonder if the authors could structure this a bit more clearly to help the reader follow and summarise the conclusions and implications more effectively (e.g. when referring back to the hypotheses, briefly summarise them). I also think that even a few changes to some of the descriptions of the results would already help. There were quite a few instances where I didn’t entirely understand what the authors attempted to say – I comment on them below. They mostly concern the interactions. These are relatively minor things by themselves, but added up they resulted in some confusion as to what the results show and what we can conclude overall.
- The authors express surprise that more right-wing governments implement more leave benefits (p. 14), but isn’t this in line with their tendency of supporting longer leave for mothers? Here the link between the amount of leave benefits and the length of leave becomes clearly relevant. Drawing such conclusions and then only addressing the more finegrained measures in the next section adds some confusion, so this should be clarified.
- I would expect high multicollinearity between left, centre, and right party cabinet share, as these shares should always add up to one/100%.
- Please clarify (p. 16): “However, the results for paid father-specific leave are significant only for the long-run effect in the model with right party cabinet share.” Does this refer to the interaction between women in cabinet and right party cabinet share, or having it as a control? The same for the sentences that follow; what is meant by “with … share”, as the coefficients referred to appear to be the ones of women in cabinet?
- Please clarify (p. 17): “For reasons of space, we only report on interactions with a significant moderating effect for at least a partial range of party cabinet share (7 interactions).” What is meant by significant moderating effects for a partial range of the moderator? Are the authors referring to the moderating effect (i.e. the interaction term) or the conditional effect of the moderated variable here?
- Please clarify (p. 17): “The positive association of women cabinet share with public expenses for childcare and leave benefits decreases with left cabinet share (Panel I. in Figure 3), but only until a cabinet share of left parties of 27.5% for the latter.” It looks like the positive association continues to decrease with left cabinet share even beyond 27.5%, which is also what we would expect by definition in a linear model. It’s just no longer statistically significant. Also, “for the latter” should be deleted as it it’s already specified that the figure refers to the share of left parties.
- Please clarify: (p. 17): “The lacking interaction effect for paid father-specific leave as well as for left party cabinet share alone does not corroborate Hypothesis 4b either.” This is unclear to me – which is the second effect referred to here (“as well as for left party cabinet share alone”)?
- Regarding this statement (p. 17): “However, the negative effect for paid leave for mothers might be interpreted as a positive message for gender equality when long and low paid leave benefits are replaced with shorter and well paid schemes.” Could this be analysed in some way, i.e. the combination of the length and amount of leave benefits?
- In the section on conditional effects the authors sometimes refer to the direct effects of one of the interacted variables, usually party share (e.g. p. 18, line 19). I cannot tell from these descriptions whether they refer to these effects from the models without the interactions or with the interactions. If the latter is the case, please be aware that these direct effects apply only to those cases where the moderating variable (women cabinet share) equals zero.

#### Conclusion
- Here, again, I find it difficult to follow the summary of the results. For instance, “independent of female ministers, left parties alone increase public childcare and the negative moderating effect for leave benefits could signal a reduction of long leave periods with low benefit levels in favour of shorter but well-paid leave schemes.” (pp. 20-21). Again, the description of the moderating effect doesn’t make sense to me as a negative moderating effect presumably means that the effect of female cabinet share on the leave periods is reduced by left-wing party share (or vice versa, this is not clear), but this doesn’t mean that there is a reduction of long leave periods – I cannot see how this conclusion is linked to the interaction effect. Or are the authors talking about the conditional effect of left party share rather than the moderating effect (see also my comment above on this)? The same issue applies to the next sentence, “The lack of a moderating effect for father-specific leave might indicate that the preferences of male and female left party ministers are aligned.” (p. 21). How is a moderating effect relevant here for the lack of an effect of female cabinet share? 
- Regarding this conclusion: “In contrast, the positive effect of female ministers on public leave expenses is higher for large cabinet shares of right parties. In a male-dominated environment women make a difference.” (p. 21), it seems that the authors deduce that right parties are more male-dominated, which sounds plausible but isn’t shown in the analysis as far as I understand; to test this we would want to use a squared measure of female cabinet share to test whether there is a non-linear effect. A final minor point: the manuscript is generally extremely well written, but in several instances the authors use “what” instead of “which”.

### Comments to the Author
This paper examines partisan effects and the effects of female political representation in cabinets on family policy, distinguishing between family allowances, childcare provision, leave benefits, and leave durations (separately for fathers and mothers). In addition to direct effects, the paper tests interactions between women’s representation in cabinets and cabinet partisanship. The paper improves on the existing literature by using a different dependent variable (expenditures per child rather than as percentage of GDP) and by employing error correction models that allow for an examination of short-run and long-run effects. The findings support some of the hypotheses: left parties increase (and right parties decrease) childcare expenses and family allowances in the short term, yet the opposite effects are found for leave benefits. Centrist governance has positive effects on short-term leave durations, but long-term effects only for fathers. Right-wing parties decrease father’s leave durations in the short and long run. In addition, some of the interaction effects support the expectations outlined in the theory.
This paper concerns an important topic, captures the theoretical state of the art, and improves on the empirical approach that has been employed in the literature. I therefore think that it has the potential for publication in EJPR. However, I have some concerns that I would invite the authors to address first.
1. First, there remains a question about the contribution of the paper. At the moment, the contribution is framed entirely in empirical – even technical – terms: better measurement of the DV, use of ECMs. This is certainly useful, but I would encourage the authors to think about what the paper’s contribution in theoretical terms could be. The theoretical argument as it stands is pretty standard, but I guess the authors want their paper to be more than just an exercise in improving the methods applied. One way to do this may be to focus more on the interaction hypotheses between female representation and partisanship – the second concern I want to raise.
2. Second, the theoretical motivation of the interaction hypotheses is not fully convincing. In the end, the authors cover all their bases, expecting either positive or no effects of left-party as well as right-party cabinet shares interacted with female representation. While I am not against putting forward competing hypotheses in principle (quite the opposite), this strikes me as a case of ‘anything is possible’, resulting from the fact that the theory is not especially strong. I would therefore recommend that the authors strengthen their theoretical argument by theorizing more explicitly how partisanship and women’s representation interact. Specifically, I think it helps to think clearly about what we should expect in terms of gender-related preferences of male and female politicians in left and right parties. As the authors state, left parties have been much more open to accept the demands of the women’s movement than right parties – and they have been much more open to having equal representation of the genders. As a consequence, men in left parties are much more likely to have internalized these ideological claims than men in right parties – even after controlling for partisanship. As a result, the gender-ideology gap between men and women is likely to be greater in right-wing parties. Therefore, we should expect women to matter more in those parties (as assumed by H5a).
3. Third, the paper presents a wealth of data and statistical tests. This makes it hard to keep track at times. For example, H1 alone produces 4 (or even 6) statistical tests (different DVs, short- and long-run effects). In the end, one of these coefficients is significant and in the expected direction (childcare, short-run). Do we now conclude that H1 has been confirmed? Similar points apply to the other hypotheses.
4. Fourth, given the amount of data and tests presented, it may be useful to include a brief table at the end that presents a very clear overview about the effects that have been found. Which short-run and long-run effects have the models yielded for the 5 DVs?

### Comments to the Author
This paper uses disaggregated data and up to date statistical methodology to examine the effect of partisanship, female political representation, and the interaction of the two variables to explain several features of family policy in 27 countries in the period 1991 to 2015. Although this is a paper with potential, I do not recommend publication in a top general interest journal such as EJPR. Here is why.

* The paper does not aim to make a theoretical contribution. Instead, the authors’ primary contribution is empirical. As they note in the introduction, they examine several hypotheses, which have already been the focus of several empirical papers, on more disaggregated data, over longer periods of time, and what they argue to be a more adequate statistical methodology. I would like to encourage the authors to think about a possible theoretical contribution that they could make.

* Their empirical findings, however, are far from conclusive. Their seven hypotheses and five dependent variables lead to a lot of findings, but these findings are not particularly robust, and they do not paint a clear picture. In fact, for this reader, the large number of dependent variables did more to confuse rather than to clarify relationships. I recommend the authors to use a table to summarize their findings. Moreover, it does not help that hypotheses 4 and 5 come in two varieties each, with hypotheses 4b and 5b essentially being the null for hypotheses 4a and 5a. After I had finished reading the paper, I was not sure what exactly this paper shows empirically. Although this is part of the authors’ contribution, I recommend the authors to cut down on the number of dependent variables (more depth, less breadth).

* Quite generally, the hypotheses are formulated in confusing ways. For hypothesis 3, the authors assume that “women’s interests are gender equality goals that improve the economic, societal, and political position of women” (p. 6). Yet, for hypothesis 4a, we read that “not all female ministers have necessarily the same preferences and political agenda” (p. 6). Put differently, the hypotheses are based on different assumptions. For hypothesis 4, it is assumed that it is left-wing female cabinet ministers who share an interest in general equality; the conservative ones not so much. Instead, for hypothesis 4a, the authors make the “critical mass assumption” (p. 7), i.e. a critical mass of left-wing female cabinet ministers is needed for an effect. But for hypothesis 4b, they argue that “there seems to be a limit to the critical mass assumption” (p. 7), which is why hypothesis 4b is the null of hypothesis 4a. For hypothesis 5a, they bring back the critical mass assumption, but this time for conservative female cabinet members. But for hypothesis 5b, they go back to the point that conservative female cabinet members might not share an interest in gender equality in the first place.

* Rather than presenting seven, partly contradictory hypotheses, each supported by one-paragraph arguments, I recommend the authors to engage more thoroughly with a smaller number of hypotheses. Clearly, the interactive argument is most promising with a view on making a theoretical contribution. Moreover, for which of the five dependent variables should we expect the interaction of female political representation and partisanship to matter and why?

* Finally, I encourage the authors to have another look at their operationalization. At the moment, they make hypotheses about the partisan orientation of the female cabinet members, but in their empirical analysis, they simply look at the share of female cabinet ministers, thus assuming that the share of female cabinet ministers is the same for all parties in a coalition government. What if a center-left coalition government (50 / 50 percent) has gender parity (50 / 50 percent), but all female cabinet members are from the center party, not from the left party? Sure, this is a stylized example, but I think it makes the point: if the partisanship of female cabinet ministers matters, the authors should measure their partisanship and not make assumptions about their partisanship based on their overall share of seats in the cabinet.

#### A few minor points:
- What about power purchasing parities (not sure whether this is taken into account)?
- Would we not expect the share of women in the cabinet to be strongly correlated with the share of women in parliament? What is the point of this control variable?
- VIFs up to eight are in fact very large. This should be avoided.
- What about endogeneity? Is female political representation the result of gender equality policies or vice versa? Are there other processes that might drive both processes (please note how the paper is framed: socioeconomic changes trigger all these policy responses (first sentence of abstract and introduction))
- Formulation of interactive hypotheses: the association (the effect) is not between the cabinet share of a given party and the effect (!) of female ministers. It is between the cabinet shares of a given party and female ministers (although, as mentioned above, I would argue that the authors have to look at the shares of female cabinet members for a given party, not the complete coalition government).
- Tables with expectations and findings for the different DVs might be helpful.
